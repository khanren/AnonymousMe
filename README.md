# AnonymousMe-Final-Year-Project

Anonymous Me was created to give Sunway University students a private forum for anonymously sharing their ideas, experiences, and views. The main goal of the app is to make it possible for kids tospeak truthfully and openly without worrying about criticism or repercussions. We have created aregistration procedure that requires students to enter their student ID to create an account to ensure
that only Sunway students can use the app. This verification procedure aids in preventing non-students from creating an account, such as instructors, parents, or students from different campuses.

Additionally, the app has a function that shows the most popular postings currently, enabling students to keep informed about what is trending in the Sunway community at present. Students may interact with others, ask questions, and share experiences while staying entirely anonymous by making use of the Anonymous Me app. This method encourages students to be more forthcoming and franker with their opinions and ideas and fosters a courteous and supportive community. Overall, Anonymous Me provides students a safe and welcoming environment to connect with one another successfully and
securely.
